# Linkedin_signin_page_clone
It's my first Web development using only HTML and CSS . I created a decent linked_in sign in page which i will try my best to get similar to the original one.
I Created this sign in page very simple without JavaScript . 
In this web page includes the form, hyperlinks, inputs, borders etc..,
 The most decent look of this page is obtained by using css properties.
